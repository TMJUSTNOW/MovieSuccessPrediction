i wanna go see gravity that movie was pretty raw
today i will gravity movie in centaurus cineplex
funny to see gravity with 2 AT_USER physicists. getting the lowdown about the flaws. but great movie nonetheless!
"AT_USER yeah! gravity is another movie that i'm really excited about, can't wait :-)"
sooo AT_USER dropped out of gravity to do a shawn levy movie. and angelina jolie turned down the film twice. i see.
gravity: a movie not for kids.. 10/10 in every aspect specially for 3d...
AT_USER either that carrie bitch movie or gravity.
"ps: just saw ""gravity"" amazing movie!!! really really cool! i liked it!!!!"
"this stupendous movie kept me gripped to the end. amazing 3d effects, certainly a joy to watch. AT_USER"
